![My Friend the Trout](/assets/img/blog/trout.jpg)

This is my friend Westin. No one knows me like he does. No one else has been there while I spent two days prying my leg from a bear trap, only to be attacked by a pack of grey wolves and lost much of the leg not a day later. No one else has tasted quite so good either.
